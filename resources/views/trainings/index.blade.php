                Step 1. Squat & place hands on the ground.
                <br> <br>
                Step 2. Jump legs back so you are in the top of the push-up position.
                <br> <br>
                Step 3. Perform a Push-Up Negative (lower yourself with control and perfect position i.e. straight line from your head to your toes).
                <br> <br>
                Step 4. Press yourself back up to the top of the push-up position.
                <br> <br>
                Step 5. Jump your feet back in and so that you are in position 1.
                <br> <br>
                Step 6. Jump and clap hands behind head.

                        <p>
                        Step 1. Put your arms straight out in front of you, parallel to the ground. Keep your chest up and proud, and your spine in a neutral position.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 2. Your weight is on your feet – it should be on the heels and the balls of your feet, as if they were pasted to the ground. You should be able to wiggle your toes the entire movement (though that’s not a part of squatting!).
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 3. Keep your entire body tight the entire time, your core flexed like you’re bracing to be punched in the gut!
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 4. Breathe deeply into your stomach, break at your hip and push your butt back. Keep sending your hips backwards as your knees begin to bend.
                        <br> <br>
                        It’s important to start with your hips back, and not by bending your knees.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 5. As you squat down, focus on keeping your knees in line with your feet.

                        <p>
                            Step 1. Have your feet apart, at least double your shoulder width but you can go wider if you want. That gives you stability. Make sure your hands are flat on the floor and in line with your shoulders. Keep your head down so you are looking down at the floor. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Step 2. Take one hand off the floor and hold it behind your back. Tense your core by pulling in your stomach. At this point you are in perfect balance. Your shoulders should be parallel to the floor, your body perfectly straight. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Step 3. Still looking at the floor exhale slowly and lower yourself towards it. Make sure you are maintaining your shoulder position so your shoulders are parallel to the floor at all times. Go as low as you can. Then, when you reach the lowest point you can, go back up again. With repetition your speed, depth and number of push-ups you can do will improve but the technique will never change.

                <div class="card-body">
                        <p>     
                        Step 1. Start in a plank position with arms and legs long. Beginning in a solid plank is the key to proper form and good results in the Mountain Climber. At its heart, the Mountain Climber is a form of plank. Keep your abs pulled in and your body straight. Squeeze your glutes and pull your shoulders away from your ears
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 2. Pull your right knee into your chest.  As the knee draws to the chest, pull your abs in even tighter to be sure your body doesn’t sag or come out of its plank position.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 3. Quickly switch and pull the left knee in. At the same time you push your right leg back, pull your left knee in to the chest using the same form.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 4. Continue to switch knees. Pull the knees in right, left, right, left—always switching simultaneously so that you are using a “running” motion. As you begin to move more quickly be in constant awareness of your body position and be sure to keep a straight line in your spine and don’t let your head droop. Core body stability is crucial.

                        Step 2. In one motion, jump your feet out to the sides and raise your arms above your head

                        Step 1. To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 2. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 3. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 4. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.

                        Step 2. Place your hands behind your head so your thumbs are behind your ears.

                        Step 5. Tilt your chin slightly, leaving a few inches of space between your chin and your chest.

                        Step 6. Gently pull your abdominals inward.

                        Step 7. Curl up and forward so that your head, neck, and shoulder blades lift off the floor.

                        Step 8. Hold for a moment at the top of the movement and then lower slowly back down.

                        Step 1. Your weight should be on the balls of your feet and your elbows. Rest your forearms on the floor with your hands locked together in front.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 2. Keep your back and hips aligned so that your body forms a straight line from shoulders to ankles.
                        <br> <br>
                        Step 3. Brace your abs. The key is not to let your hips sag, or raise them too high. It’s all about forming a straight line, much like a plank of wood. You don’t see a plank of wood sagging at the hips do you?
